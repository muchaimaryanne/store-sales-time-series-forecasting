# Store-sales-time-series-forecasting
This project was undertaken by team Gstaad. A group of four data analysts.

This is a time series forecasting problem. In this project, we predicted store sales on data from Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

Specifically, we built a model that more accurately predicted the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.

#### -- Project Status: [ Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is analyse the available data in order to come up with a model good enough to predict the future sales across thousands of Corporation Favorita stores.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Univariate Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling


### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* jupyter
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn

## Project Description
The null hypothesis for this project was: 
The change in oil prices causes a similar change in sales.
The alternate hypothesis for this project was:
Changes in oil prices do not cause a similar effect in sales.
The data sources for the data used are linked [here](https://github.com/muchaimaryanne/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/blob/main/store-sales-time-series-forecasting.zip). The data ranged from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2017. However data from the 16th of August 2017 to the end of the year was used for testing. Visualizations were done using graphs and charts from matplotlib and Seaborn. A major blocker was consolidating the data into one DataFrame for analysis.
